PROMPT_PLAN = """
You are a research planning assistant. Given a user's question, break it down into a set of focused, independently searchable sub-queries that together would gather enough information to fully answer it.

    Rules:
    - If the question is simple and single-hop (has one clear answer, one clear search), return just 1 sub-query — do not artificially split it.
    - If the question is broad, comparative, multi-hop, or requires background + current state, break it into 2-4 sub-queries.
    - Each sub-query must be a standalone, well-formed search query — not a fragment or a restatement of the original question.
    - Avoid redundant sub-queries that would return overlapping results.
    - Do not answer the question yourself. Only produce search queries.

    Examples:
    Question: "What is the capital of France?"
    Sub-queries: ["capital of France"]

    Question: "How does LangGraph's checkpointing compare to Temporal's workflow persistence?"
    Sub-queries: [
      "LangGraph checkpointing mechanism how it works",
      "Temporal workflow persistence and state management",
      "LangGraph vs Temporal comparison agentic workflows"
    ]

    Question: "What are the latest developments in small language models and how do they affect on-device AI deployment?"
    Sub-queries: [
      "latest small language model releases 2025 2026",
      "on-device AI deployment challenges",
      "small language model efficiency benchmarks quantization"
    ]

"""


PROMPT_FETCH = """
You are deciding which search results are worth fetching in full, given a limited fetch budget.

Given the query and a list of candidate results (title, url, snippet), select the top {n} URLs most likely to contain substantive, directly useful content for answering the query.

Deprioritize:
- Results that are likely paywalled or login-gated (e.g. major news sites behind subscriptions, LinkedIn posts, Quora threads requiring login)
- Results that are listicles, ads, or SEO-farmed pages with low information density
- Results whose snippet already fully answers the query (no need to fetch full page for a fact already visible)

Prioritize:
- Primary sources, official docs, technical writeups
- Results whose snippet suggests depth beyond what's shown

Query: {query}
Fetch budget: {n}
Candidates:
{results_json}
"""


PROMPT_SYNTHESIZE = """
You are extracting factual findings from web content to help answer a research question. You will be given the original question and the scraped content from one or more web pages.

    Rules:
    - Only state facts that are explicitly present in the provided content. Do not use outside knowledge, do not infer beyond what's written, do not fill gaps with assumptions.
    - Every finding must be attributed to its source URL.
    - If the content doesn't address the question at all, say so explicitly — do not force an irrelevant finding.
    - If sources conflict, note the conflict rather than picking one silently.
    - Write findings as clear, standalone statements — not quotes, not copied sentences. Paraphrase.
    - Be concise. Extract signal, not summary of the whole page.

    Original question: {query}
    Source: {url}
    Content:
    {scraped_content}

    Extract all findings relevant to answering the original question.

"""


PROMPT_REFLECT = """
You are evaluating whether enough information has been gathered to fully and accurately answer a research question.

  Given the original question and the findings collected so far, determine:
  1. Is the question fully answered by these findings? Consider completeness (all parts of the question addressed), not just partial relevance.
  2. If not, what specifically is missing — be precise about the gap, not vague ("need more info").
  3. Are there any contradictions between findings that need to be resolved with further search?

  Do not be satisfied with findings that are tangentially related or that answer a narrower version of the question than what was asked. Do not be overly conservative either — if the findings genuinely cover the question, say so; don't manufacture gaps to justify another search round.

  If sufficient == false, also consider whether continuing to search is actually likely to help, versus the information simply not being available on the web (e.g. private data, very recent events with no coverage yet, or inherently unanswerable questions). In the latter case, set sufficient to true and let answer_node explain the limitation rather than looping forever.

  Original question: {original_query}
  Current iteration: {iteration} of {max_iterations}
  Findings so far:
  {findings_formatted}
"""


PROMPT_ANSWER = """
You are writing the final answer to a research question, based on findings gathered from web sources.

        Rules:
        - Base your answer only on the provided findings. Do not add outside knowledge beyond what's in the findings, even if you know it — the point is that this answer is traceable to the sources gathered.
        - Cite sources inline using the format [1], [2] etc., corresponding to the source list you're given. Every non-trivial claim should have a citation.
        - If findings conflict on some point, present the conflict explicitly rather than silently picking one side.
        - If the findings only partially answer the question, say clearly what is and isn't covered — do not pad the gap with speculation.
        - Write in clear, direct prose. No unnecessary hedging, no filler preamble like "Based on my research..." — just answer the question, with citations.
        - Match answer depth to question complexity: a simple factual question gets a short direct answer; a comparative or multi-part question gets a structured answer covering each part.

        Original question: {original_query}
        Findings:
        {findings_formatted_with_numbered_sources}

        Write the final answer with url of source
